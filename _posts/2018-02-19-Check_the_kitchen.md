I've recently been looking through the job market in West London to find a new role, and one thought process came to mind. I ended up interviewing at the office downstairs, which shares the same cleaning team and similar type of work (both are development teams with some project and programme management).

One thing I noticed was a difference in the use of the kitchen and toilet spaces.

If they're the same cleaning team, then why would one kitchen have acres of dirty dishes in the sink and an empty dishwasher, but the other have clean areas to live in.

The same was reflected in the toilet facilities - one just seemed to have more care taken about it. The only difference between the two was the floor of the building they were on.

I'm wondering if this tidyness and cleanliness is a reasonable proxy for the social state of the company as a whole. I can't think of reasons why - whether those users of the toilets and kitchen space have less respect for their environment (and co-workers use of that environment) and whether that should be a proxy metric you should use when interviewing.

Of course, it could probably be reflective of a host of other problems - crunches which leave you without free time, or running from meeting to meeting without time to think, or maybe just one or two badly behaved individuals. But then, would you want to work in a company like that?

I'm not sure where I'm really going with this. Am I saying we should ask for a photo of the kitchen before we agree to interview? Or that it's most important to keep the kitchen clean for attracting people to your company?

I don't know.
