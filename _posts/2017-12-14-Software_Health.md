Identifying quantified information on the health of a project is Really Hard. Technical Debt backlogs, grooming processes, retrospectives. They all provide some quantative nature of the 'debt' of a project, but the only real way to get an actual idea is to get hands deep into the code and see where it is.

OH GODS BUT THAT TAKES TIME

Yes. Yes it does. Don't do that, don't spend hours a week working out the details of the technical debt in your backlog. It's just not worth it.

HOW DO WE DO IT THEN?

Well, if you do come across some explicit technical debt, don't change that - don't stop keeping track of that in a backlog, keep playing whack-a-mole to keep those bits down.

But that doesn't tell all the story. Everyone knows there's the difference between the backlog of things and the 'stuff we'll never work on'.

WHAT THEN? TELL ME WHAT TO DO!

Yes, I should tell you what to do. >.>

As many (hands please?) of you may already have used, we're starting to get a grip on team health as part of using very short, regular pulse surveys.

They are not perfect. Not everyone enjoys them. But they do provide some idea of what's going on, especially if not taken in absolute, but taken in relative.

The question we've chosen to ask is simple:

0 -----------------|---------- 10

How much technical debt do we have in #insert project here#

WHAT DOES THIS GIVE US?

Not much. Not for weeks and weeks of doing this. What you'll see is all sorts of outputs:


--------------|-------------

Blip time when something bad happens

_________....-------^^^^^

Oh gods it's getting worse

I don't think this helps, i don't want to do this.
