My moderate-fitness activities during our week around and about in Cornwall.

Cycling
-------

The [Cornish Coast-to-Coast](https://cycle.travel/route/cornish_coast_to_coast) path is definitely a good start in Cornwall. Starting at a random location and going somewhere else will definitely find yourself going up a 12% hill before too long, so picking a route that's known-flat(ish) will help.


This route is level (given you're crossing from coast to coast) and while there's a 100m climb, it's evenly spaced across the route, and once you're at the top you don't need to climb again for the rest of the route.

The path takes you along an old mining railway, past pits and through valleys from one side to the other. There's very little road work, and in the main that can be managed by using the shared pavements.

Kayaking
--------

So we hired some sit-on sea kayaks from a cafe/shop in Portholland, for no reason other than we wandered past a sign showing hires as we walked past it on one of our hikes. A few hundred in cash as a deposit, and fifty for a double and two singles for the afternoon.

I wouldn't go out alone or too far if you've not kayaked before, but we had someone with a bronze in river canoeing, and two others who'd kayaked on lakes before. You do need to know your limits and not end up a statistic by being too tired to make it back if the wind picks up, or you need to fight against the tide.

Warnings over; we travelled about 3km in total up the shore to the next main beach for an icecream, stopping off at one of the beaches you can only access from the sea. That took nearly 3 hours, with breaks and madly zigzagging as the tide and wind moved us around. And yes, it was a calm day.

Walking
-------

Obviously, the South West Coast Path is the thing to go for. Perching on a narrow dirt path on a cliff hundreds of meters above the sea has to be the best way to see the coast (if you're not willing to go out on the sea in a kayak).

Don't get caught out by thinking that a short walk of few miles is 'easy' though, Every river you cross means a descent and climb back up to level, and the coast wends back and forth compared to the straight(ish) lines of a road. What took three hours to walk on the cliff edge took us fourty five minutes to walk back on the road over the headland.

Lands End vs Lizard Point
-------------------------

Don't. Just don't go to Lands End. It's a Tourist Attraction with Coach Park and 4D Wallace and Gromit showing. You can admittedly circle around it and with your back to it, it's fine, but... I didn't enjoy.

If you want to be at a most *mumble* place in Cornwall, go to Lizard Point - the most southerly point instead. There's the remains of a boathouse, a National Trust shop and a few local art shops. Much better.
